2270pick: I used a dremel to cut a slot in the end of the tube for the tip to fit into and superglued it into place. Might have to file/sand the inside of the tube after. Handle attaches with m3 heat set insert and m3 screw. Screw also serves as a guide for degrees of rotation so tighten it when it lines up with the gap in the tip.

Back covers: Designed for resin but FDM should be fine as well.

Mounts: Designed to fit S&G, LaGard, Mosler, and Diebold with minimal space and material used.

Safe lock: Fully 3D printed group 2 mechanical safe lock.
