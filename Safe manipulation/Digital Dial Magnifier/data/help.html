	<h1>Setting up the Encoder</h1>
	<p>
		1. Slide the base onto the front of the safe<br>
		2. Slide the encoder onto the metal rod and make sure it's centered on the dial before tightening the screw onto the rod.<br>
		3. If there's not enough friction to spin the encoder then you may need to simply tape it onto the dial. It doesn't take much to get it spinning well with the dial.
