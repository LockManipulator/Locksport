# USAGE

Put 0.81mm piano wire into the wire cutter to cut them to length and then lightly tap them into place in the reset tool. To reset a lock, put the lock cylinder in the body, insert the reset tool into the bottom holes, turn the plug (it should turn roughly 10 degrees), remove the reset tool, continue turning the plug to 90 degrees to rekey.

Holes in the top are for decoding and I'll be uploading a decoding tool for it soon.
